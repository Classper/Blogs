## Blogs

Being a cloud engineer means you need to like coffee... because you have to wait big time every now and then.  
This isn't much of a problem if you're sure your deployments will work like a charm right out of the box, unfortunately Murphy's law also applies to cloud computing.  
That's why I decided to write some blogs, so you don't have to make the same mistakes that I've already made!  
Azure DevOps, pipelines, automation and C# are examples of topic for which I'll write tips&tricks about, together with other random tips and tricks that I found useful.

This series of blogs will hopefully help you out debugging some problems you'll encounter along the way and let you spend more time implementing new features!
